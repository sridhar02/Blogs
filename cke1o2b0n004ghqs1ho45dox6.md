## Some of the famous Podcasts in Tech?

Hi everyone!. Today lets talk about podcasts, I think they are a very important part of software engineers life as we tend to write code listing to some podcast or music which help you to focus more on the work we do in a particular block of time. I find them so much interesting some times we learn a topic from the podcast while coding at the same time and listing them online they also provide great notes which we can refer to after listing to them passively. 

- This is the general  Wikipedia definition of a podcast 
> A podcast is an episodic series of spoken word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal device for easy listening. Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient, integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.

These are some of my favorite podcasts I listen   

1.[Syntax](https://syntax.fm/): The best web development podcasts by Wesbos and Scott. They cover a wide variety of topics regarding web development. They also have Potluck questions where you send a question to them they will answer them in the show. They are play games during podcasts. I love this show and in some episodes, they provide SIIIIICK ××× PIIIICKS.

2.[Reactpodcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/): This is also one of the favorite ones by chantastic, where he invites one guest to the show and explain about the of the recent topics.

3.[LadyBug podcast](https://www.ladybug.dev/): This is done by Emma Bostian, Kelly Vaughn, and Ali Spittel - three seasoned software developers working in different sectors. The discussions around how to start coding, the hot technologies right now, how to get your first developer job, and more!

4.[Rework](https://rework.fm/): This is a company podcast called Basecamp, they discuss remote work, how they value employees in basecamp, they are an awesome company and I value them a lot like my ideal remote company.

5.[Learning Curve Podcast](https://learningcurve.dev/): This is not a famous one but started by two developers from India, I really like them as I find them as two friends talking casually to each other with some meaning full insights about career, tech, and some great advice to others.i compare them as mini syntax.

They are a lot of podcasts other than these choose the one which you like and inculcate them in your daily life as we code and at the same time, we can learn new things. Not only to Tech they are a lot of areas which are covered in different podcasts search them listen to them.
